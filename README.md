These codes and results are in support of 
Jones, Fabrycky, & Mills 2017.

Section 2 of the paper derives the orbit, and IDL code that gives these results can be found in mcorbitker2.pro. 
The resulting chain of parameters is found in xx.
The dynamical code that is used for the investigation is called yy.c.

Section 3 of the paper gives dynamical results. 
The files that were used to make the plots are tarred up in zz.tar.
