# Alpha-Centauri-Triple-Dynamics

These codes and results are in support of 
Jones & Fabrycky 2017.

Section 2 of the paper derives the orbit, and IDL code that gives these results can be found in mcorbitker2.pro. 
The resulting chain of parameters is found in mcorbitker2.txt.

Section 3 of the paper gives dynamical results. 
These are converted into dynamical simulation input files by mkin2ker2.pro; 
those files are the 100 in insker2.tar -- one extra one is to test the GR precession without Proxima. 
The dynamical code that is used for the investigation is called tripledyn.c; its header describes how it is compiled.
The input files were sent to this code on the Midway supercomputer at University of Chicago, resulting in the
output files within outsker2.tar.gz. Â 
Those output files were processed into the main results of the paper using plotkepfbplbker2gr.pro.
